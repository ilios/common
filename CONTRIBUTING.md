## Running an API server for development Using Docker and Docker Compose

For the fastest way to get up and running with Ilios for your development purposes, we HIGHLY recommend using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Install Docker

You will need Docker and Docker compose:

- [OS X](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
- [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

### Running a local development server

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Accessing Ilios

You should now be able to access your newly-Dockerized instance of Ilios 
by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Shutting down the development server

From your ILIOS_CODE directory run:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

### Point Common at the API Server

1. Create a `.env` file in the source code directory
2. Add `ILIOS_FRONTEND_API_HOST=http://localhost:8000` on it's own line to the `.env` file
